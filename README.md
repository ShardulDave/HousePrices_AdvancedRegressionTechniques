# HousePrices_AdvancedRegressionTechniques

* My first project on Machine Learning. 
* A project competition taken from kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

## Goal

* To predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of 
the SalePrice variable. 

## Features

* Total 80 features

## Tools Used

* Python 3.7 (https://docs.python.org/3/)
* Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/)
* pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* NumPy (http://www.numpy.org/#)
 
## Result

* Accuracy using Logistic Regression is 0.005479452054794521
* Accuracy using Decision Tree is 0.0136986301369863
* Accuracy using KNN Classifier is 0.00821917808219178
* Accuracy using Random Forest Regression is 0.40399259640650076
